## varyaml

Ever wanted to reference environment arguments inside your config file?

```yaml
db:
    host: database.internal.dns
    port: $DBPORT
    username: $DBUSER
    password: rosebud
    # todo: make password an env arg for security? nah
```

When you load this file with varyaml, DBPORT and DBUSER will be read from your environment and the loader will **crash** (yes) if they're missing.

Why is this important? Orchestration frameworks prefer to pass args in as env vars, but programs are easier to understand (and type-check) if they have config files. This tool lets you have both.

### Usage

```python
import varyaml
CONF = varyaml.load('{}')
# or
CONF = varyaml.load(open('config.yml'))

print(CONF['db']['host'])
```

### Installation

```bash
pip install varyaml
# or
pip install git+git://github.com/abe-winter/varyaml
```

### Reading vars from disk

Some orchestration frameworks put secrets on disk. You can get at them like this:

```yaml
db:
    password: $DB_PASS
varyaml:
    path: /run/secrets
```

In this example, varyaml will check first for an environment var named DB_PASS, then it will read the contents /run/secrets/DB_PASS if the file exists, then it will go to defaults (not provided in this sample), then crash if not found.

### Default values

You can specify defaults (i.e. make the environment var optional).

(todo: what if the top-level object isn't a dictionary?)

The special string value `__omit__` says to pop the key if not found.

```yaml
db:
    port: $DBPORT
    username: $DBUSER
    database: $DBNAME
varyaml:
    defaults:
        DBPORT: 5432
        DBNAME: __omit__
    path: /run/secrets
```

### Parsing environment vars as yaml

When `parse_env` is true in the `varyaml` section, the engine will parse all environment vars as yaml. This is useful for bools, integers, and deep values (i.e. dictionaries) that you want to override.

Example:

```yaml
yes: $YES
varyaml:
    defaults:
        YES: true
    parse_env: true
```

With `parse_env`, setting `YES=false` in the shell will result in a python bool False. Without `parse_env`, you'd get the string `'false'`.

### Environment overrides & merging

The parser takes an `overrides` section which can be used to set different defaults for different environments where your code runs. The order of precedence is:

* env vars take highest priority
* then on-disk in varyaml.path
* then check for overrides in the current env
* then look in the defaults section

Overrides are controlled with environment vars. Example (controlled with `APP_ENV`):

```yaml
db:
    host: $DBHOST
varyaml:
    overrides:
    - __filter__: {APP_ENV: prod}
      DBHOST: managed-db.cloudhost.com
    # note: these are 'or' conditions. (env=staging or env=test)
    - __filter__: {APP_ENV: staging, APP_ENV: test}
      DBHOST: db.local
```

There's a working example in [`test_overrides` in the test suite](https://github.com/abe-winter/varyaml/search?q=test_overrides).

Design guidance for overrides:

* Put per-environment overrides in your checked-in config file
* Except anything that needs to be changed a lot, which you should make an env var or fetch from a live config system
* And except secrets, which you should pass as environment vars or on disk

### Python versions & release status

This is in beta release as of June 2017. The test suite is limited and not informed by any real-world snafus.

I think pyyaml doesn't support yaml aliases, but if it does is there a possibility of circular references? If that happens `varyaml.process` (called by `load`) will hang.

Tested on py3.5. Probably works on anything recent that supports pyyaml.

### Contributions

* Blog posts on using this in the wild (a) will be appreciated and (b) may be linked to from this spot if they're good.
* I'm not sure if I need env var redirection (i.e. `DEFAULT_HOST=localhost DBHOST='$DEFAULT_HOST'`). If you have a use case and you want to add the feature (disabled by default), send a pull request with tests.
* Escaping for dollar signs in config values (currently they're always converted to environment vars)
